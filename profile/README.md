34M,aftera10.9M Friday, and even a Saturday family lift of $13.2M, we can’t ignore the fact that we’ve seen better from The Rock, as far as his solo non-Fast & Furious projects go. EntTelligence says that only 2.4M people watched Sonic the Hedgehog 3 this weekend — which ain’t much.

The movie’s A- CinemaScore is better than Johnson’s Black Adam and Skyscraper‘s B+s and the same as Rampage. The 88% on Rotten Tomatoes from audiences is the same as Black Adam. Comscore/Screen Engine audiences were harder with 78% positive, 57% definite recommend with kids under 12 better at 91% and 51% must-see right away. Best demos were 18-24 and over 55 at 20% apiece. Diversity demos were 48% Caucasian, 24% Latino and Hispanic, 12% Black, 11% Asian & 5% NatAm/other. Imax and PLF drove 38% of the gross. Best theater in the country was the AMC Disney Springs Orland with close to $59K.

But, damn, if this isn’t a high budget. That’s the biggest problem here with Sonic the Hedgehog 3 overall. However, that’s what you get when you do business with the industrial complex that is the Rock. The gossip can cry tardiness, entourages, water bottles, schedules, studio execs asleep at the wheel and an exorbitant amount of jelly beans in Rock’s trailer — it doesn’t matter. Capisce? This is what it costs to get into business with Johnson, and the only ones who are bold enough to invest in this endeavor are streamers like Netflix with Red Notice and Amazon MGM Studios here with Sonic the Hedgehog 3. The Rock has yet to scale down the budget of one of his tentpoles.

First, to placate the irate, traditional model studio brass who want to put Sonic the Hedgehog 3 side-by-side with the performance of Joker: Folie a Deux, let’s recognize the fact here that this opening for Sonic the Hedgehog 3 is on the lower end of Johnson’s original IP, higher than Skyscraper (
